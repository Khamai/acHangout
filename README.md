# acHangout
#### For our project, we have decided to build a forum, similar to websites such as reddit, and other forum websites out there today. To do this, we have several features that will be implemented to complete this project.
.
●	Depending on the tab (sport, food, media), different features will be implemented
●	Food tab - able to view and rate various restaurants, see their location, interact with other users
●	Media tab - images, videos, 
●	Sport tab - post threads, articles on different types of sports, discuss with other users
●	Education tab - courses on an assortment of subjects such as math, science, programming are placed here, do quizzes, discuss with other users
●	Users can create New Sub-categories  

This forum, like many others, will be a place of discussion and hanging out with others that have the same common interests. Users will be able to create threads in any of the four discussion tabs (food, sports, media, education), after which, other users can actively participate by posting comments relevant to that thread. 

All four discussion tabs will have a broad range of topics to choose from, so whether you’re into sports or food, there’s a community out there for you.
